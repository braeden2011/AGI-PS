Bugs it workbench is running (not pointstudio or vulcan.... is it only looking for multiple pointstudio instances with a text reach of the application list?)

running just the PS workflow makes a dir in the input folder, then running Agi workflowe spits chips too many dir, need to multithread?

try / catch for all the exports

Load a config file for each machine specifying base folder paths
    Import dir
    Export dir (same as import, maybe subfolder to avoid issues if has to run more than once, then preclude export subfolder from scanning for files?)
Decide how to pass the project name back and forth between Agisoft python <-> PS python <-> PS workflow <-> PS python
QA to export into the export Dir


#feature
Process_Scan_with_PythonV2.wfd should be pointed to the right files for current iteration.

multi project support edited files so far:
Process_Scan_with_PythonV3.wfd 
Process Pickup_S1_V3.py 
Process Pickup_S2_V3.py
writeQACSV_S3.py
agi_and_PS_process_V3.py (pretty sure this just changes to importing writeQACSV_S3.py to account for topo in topo object name and maybe changed folder location of the topo)
Also need to make a new .bat to launch agi_and_PS_process_V3.py



#Multi-thread / deal with multiple input folders
agi processing - multithreaded. 
    when windows dir renamed ready, rename to processing then agi process, after processing label complete
    Make a new project dir in PS for laz and topo for each thread

PS process manaul start, and iterate through all the project dirs in working? 



comprehensive logging

Account for GCP's

add support for older versions of Agisoft

Option to review pic err values in agisoft after aligning?
