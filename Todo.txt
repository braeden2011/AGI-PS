Need try / catch for: 
    loading photos?
    laoding camera cal for each camera / photo
    loading residuals /  accuracies for each camera / photo

Fails to save after opening the project in GUI for GCP picking

Need to put agisoft settings into a YAML config file

Gui inputs (project folder, topo.csv, cal.xml, gcp.csv)
    Optional: If there is a csv in the project folder auto find topo SH and GCPs and extract into seperate files

Python project Save after GCP picking doesnt work



When agi_and_PS_process.py calls PS, it just runs a workflow with hard coded PS path locations to look in.....
    User input to make sure correct PS DB is open
        Once imported -> run workflow that looks in hardcoded PS location
            for each /laz found do stuff.... 
                if there is a matching topo, use it and QA






try / catch for all the exports

Load a config file for each machine specifying base folder paths? or use gui project folder picker instead?
    import dir 
    Export dir (same as import\export, maybe subfolder to avoid issues if has to run more than once, then preclude export subfolder from scanning for files?)
Decide how to pass the project name back and forth between Agisoft python <-> PS python <-> PS workflow <-> PS python
QA to export into the export Dir







comprehensive logging






#bug

Bugs if workbench is running (not pointstudio or vulcan.... is it only looking for multiple pointstudio instances with a text search of the application list?)

running just the PS workflow makes a dir in the input folder, then running Agi workflowe spits chips too many dir, need to multithread?




#Maybe dont multithread like this yet...
Process_Scan_with_PythonV2.wfd should be pointed to the right files for current iteration.

multi project support edited files so far:
Process_Scan_with_PythonV3.wfd 
Process Pickup_S1_V3.py 
Process Pickup_S2_V3.py
writeQACSV_S3.py
agi_and_PS_process_V3.py (pretty sure this just changes to importing writeQACSV_S3.py to account for topo in topo object name and maybe changed folder location of the topo)
Also need to make a new .bat to launch agi_and_PS_process_V3.py



#Multi-thread / deal with multiple input folders
agi processing - multithreaded. 
    when windows dir renamed ready, rename to processing then agi process, after processing label complete
    Make a new project dir in PS for laz and topo for each thread

PS process manaul start, and iterate through all the project dirs in working?
